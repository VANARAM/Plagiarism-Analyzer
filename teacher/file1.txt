Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in data (KDD), is the process of
uncovering patterns and other valuable information from large data sets. Given 
the evolution of data warehousing technology and the growth of big data, adoption 
of data mining techniques has rapidly accelerated over the last couple of decades, 
assisting companies by transforming their raw data into useful knowledge.
