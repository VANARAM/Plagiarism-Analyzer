# Plagiarism-Analyzer
In my latest project, I created a website that functions similarly to Moodle. The platform allows teachers to upload assignments for their students to complete and submit. Additionally, teachers have the ability to check for plagiarism in the submitted assignments. The website is designed to facilitate seamless communication between teachers and students, making the learning process more efficient and convenient for everyone involved.
